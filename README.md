Hello, for now here is a link to my front end.

'https://github.com/averagealloy/cashdash-client'


What is this?

Good Question, This is where all of the data is manipulated, changed, and stored. 

How does this work? 

Another good question you are on a roll, this is only one half of the cookie. Above you will find a link to the front end of my project(react/redux). But just to see the how some of the accounts look run 'rails s -p 3001' in your terminal. It says '-p 3001' because the other portion of this application runs on port 3000.(you can see your accounts here http://localhost:3001/api/v1/accounts)
